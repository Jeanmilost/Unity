# Unity
This repository contains several demo projects realized with the Unity game engine.

## 1st person view
This project demonstrates a possible solution for a first person view with an attached animated model. The scene contains a mirror, and the body is visible when the player lowers his head.

## 3rd person view
This project demonstrates a possible solution for a third person view.

## Drawing curves
This project contains a small 3D Bezier curve component, which may be added into a scene. I use a such component in several game projects, e.g to show a line of sight towards a target.

## Survival Demo Scene
This is a small survival horror demo scene, showing how a Resident Evil like may be created with Unity. The demo contains 2 rooms and a door opening interlude. A zombie is also present in a room, with a part of its AI implemented. He can walk to and attack the player.
